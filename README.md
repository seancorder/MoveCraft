Movecraft
======

This is a modified version of Movecraft.  The main features include:
always piloted/sinkable  ships (Persistant Pilot) 
ship detection (ShipChunkDetection) 
Free or Fee repair (FreeRepair) 
Re-piloting a damaged ship will not re-calculate the ship and percentage damage will remain relevant for a set time period (so an attack cannot be escaped by cheating).  This is controled by LastDamageRequrement, which is a setting in minutes.  Once the minutes runs out the ship can be recalculated.  (probably, the player will just repair the ship).

Movecraft 3 is the premier movement plugin for bukkit.
